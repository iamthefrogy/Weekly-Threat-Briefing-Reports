#### **Qilin Ransomware Rampage — Group Becomes One of World's Most Active, Targets Veeam Backups**

- **Facts:**
    *   The Qilin (also known as Agenda) ransomware group has become one of the most prolific, publishing information on over 40 victims per month in the second half of 2025. The manufacturing sector is the most affected【https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uncovering-qilin-attack-methods-exposed-through-multiple-cases/ (2025-10-28T05:00:04.000Z)】【https://thecyberexpress.com/qilin-ransomware-group-ttps/ (2025-10-27T17:30:09.000Z)】.
    *   Recent attack analysis reveals sophisticated TTPs, including deploying a Linux variant of their ransomware on Windows systems via remote management tools like Splashtop and using Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) to disable EDR solutions【https://thecyberexpress.com/qilin-ransomware-group-ttps/ (2025-10-27T17:30:09.000Z)】【https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/qilin-ransomware-combines-linux-payload.html (2025-10-27T14:25:00.000Z)】.
    *   The group specifically targets Veeam backup infrastructure, using custom PowerShell scripts to extract and decrypt stored credentials from Veeam databases to compromise disaster recovery capabilities before encryption【https://thecyberexpress.com/qilin-ransomware-group-ttps/ (2025-10-27T17:30:09.000Z)】.
    *   For data exfiltration, Qilin has been observed abusing the legitimate open-source tool Cyberduck. During reconnaissance, attackers have also used `notepad.exe` and `mspaint.exe` to view files containing sensitive information【https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uncovering-qilin-attack-methods-exposed-through-multiple-cases/ (2025-10-28T05:00:04.000Z)】【https://cybersecuritynews.com/qilin-ransomware-leveraging-mspaint-and-notepad/ (2025-10-27T13:49:42.000Z)】.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that Qilin is a highly capable and dangerous threat. Their tactic of targeting and compromising backup systems before deploying ransomware is designed to maximize impact and pressure victims into paying. **Confidence: High** (Based on detailed technical reports from Cisco Talos and Trend Micro).
    *   The use of legitimate tools (`mspaint`, `notepad`, `Cyberduck`) and cross-platform attacks (Linux ransomware on Windows) demonstrates an intent to evade standard security monitoring and complicate detection efforts. **Confidence: High** (Corroborated by multiple incident response analyses).
- **Relevance:**
    *   Any organization, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is a potential target. Our use of Veeam for backups makes us particularly vulnerable to their credential harvesting TTPs.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact
    *   T1562.001: Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools
    *   T1114.002: Email Collection: Remote Email Collection (related to credential theft from backups)
    *   T1567.002: Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (via Cyberduck)
    *   T1059.001: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor for the execution of unusual processes like `mspaint.exe` or `notepad.exe` by privileged service accounts or from remote sessions, especially when accessing sensitive file shares.
    *   Hunt for anomalous network traffic patterns to cloud storage providers that are not standard for the organization, which could indicate Cyberduck usage for exfiltration.
    *   Create alerts for PowerShell scripts accessing Veeam database files (`.mdf`, `.ldf`).
    *   **Sigma Rule:**
```yaml\n        title: Qilin Ransomware Veeam Credential Harvesting\n        status: experimental\n        description: Detects PowerShell execution with command-line arguments related to Veeam SQL databases, a TTP used by Qilin ransomware.\n        logsource:\n            category: process_creation\n            product: windows\n        detection:\n            selection:\n                Image|endswith:\n                    - '\powershell.exe'\n                    - '\pwsh.exe'\n                CommandLine|contains|all:\n                    - 'Veeam'\n                    - 'Backup'\n                    - 'Database'\n                    - 'SELECT'\n            condition: selection\n        falsepositives:\n            - Legitimate Veeam administration scripts.\n        level: medium\n        ```
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Implement strict access controls on backup servers and databases. Ensure multi-factor authentication is required for all administrative access.
    *   Use application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized tools like `Cyberduck` from running on critical servers.
    *   Regularly audit backup integrity and perform recovery tests from offline, immutable backups.

#### **Chrome Zero-Day (CVE-2025-2783) Exploited in Espionage Campaign by Hacking Team Successor**

- **Facts:**
    *   A Chrome sandbox escape zero-day, CVE-2025-2783, was exploited in a campaign named "Operation ForumTroll" targeting Russian and Belarusian organizations, including media, government, and financial institutions【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/italian-spyware-vendor-linked-to-chrome-zero-day-attacks/ (2025-10-28T05:00:10.000Z)】【https://securityaffairs.com/183913/apt/memento-labs-the-ghost-of-hacking-team-has-returned-or-maybe-it-was-never-gone-at-all.html (2025-10-27T20:31:13.000Z)】.
    *   The campaign delivered malware by tricking targets into clicking a malicious link, which was enough to infect the system via the browser vulnerability【https://cybersecuritynews.com/chrome-0-day-vulnerability-hackers-exploited/ (2025-10-27T10:57:51.000Z)】.
    *   Security researchers at Kaspersky have linked the toolset used in the attacks to the Italian spyware vendor Memento Labs, the successor to the infamous Hacking Team. The payload delivered was a commercial spyware product named "Dante"【https://securelist.com/forumtroll-apt-hacking-team-dante-spyware/117851/ (2025-10-27T13:59:23.000Z)】【https://cyberscoop.com/hacking-team-dante-spyware-kaspersky/ (2025-10-27T17:01:34.000Z)】.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that the involvement of a commercial spyware vendor indicates this capability is likely available to multiple state-level actors for targeted espionage. The zero-day exploitation lowers the barrier for successful compromise significantly. **Confidence: High** (Based on in-depth analysis and attribution by Kaspersky).
    *   Although the observed targeting was specific to Russia and Belarus, the zero-day vulnerability itself is platform-agnostic and affects all users of unpatched Chromium-based browsers, posing a global risk until patched. **Confidence: High** (Vulnerability is inherent to the browser, not the target).
- **Relevance:**
    *   Our organization uses Chrome as its standard browser. All employees are potentially vulnerable to this attack vector until all systems are updated.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1204.001: User Execution: Malicious Link
    *   T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
    *   T1211: Exploitation for Client Execution
- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   While specific detection of the exploit is difficult post-patch, monitoring for anomalous network connections from browser processes to unknown IPs or domains shortly after a user clicks a link can be an indicator.
    *   EDR solutions should be configured to alert on browser processes spawning unexpected child processes like `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Ensure all instances of Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Microsoft Edge) are updated to a version that patches CVE-2025-2783【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/italian-spyware-vendor-linked-to-chrome-zero-day-attacks/ (2025-10-28T05:00:10.000Z)】.
    *   Use web filtering and email security to block access to suspicious and uncategorized domains.

#### **Everest Ransomware Hits Swedish Power Grid Operator in Critical Infrastructure Attack**

- **Facts:**
    *   Svenska kraftnät, Sweden's national power grid operator, confirmed on October 26, 2025, that it suffered a data breach【https://gbhackers.com/swedens-power-grid-operator-admits-data-breach/ (2025-10-28T08:07:46.000Z)】.
    *   The Everest ransomware group has claimed responsibility, stating they stole approximately 280 GB of internal data and threatened to leak it if their demands are not met【https://therecord.media/sweden-power-grid-operator-data (2025-10-28T06:44:10.000Z)】.
    *   Svenska kraftnät has stated that the breach affected an external file transfer system and has not impacted operational systems or the stability of the electric grid. The incident has been reported to the police【https://therecord.media/sweden-power-grid-operator-data (2025-10-28T06:44:10.000Z)】.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess this incident as a significant attack on European critical infrastructure, even if direct operational systems were not compromised. The theft of internal data from a national grid operator can expose sensitive information about infrastructure, personnel, and security procedures that could be used in future, more disruptive attacks. **Confidence: High** (Based on company confirmation and actor claims).
    *   The choice of target aligns with a growing trend of ransomware actors targeting high-value, high-impact organizations to increase pressure for payment. **Confidence: Medium** (While the trend is clear, Everest's specific motivation in this case is not confirmed).
- **Relevance:**
    *   This incident is a stark reminder of the threat posed to the energy and utilities sector. It underscores the importance of segmenting networks to ensure that breaches of peripheral or external-facing systems do not provide a path to critical operational technology (OT) environments.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1212: Exploitation for Credential Access
    *   T1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact (Though data theft for extortion is the primary tactic here)
- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor for large, unexpected data outflows from any system, particularly file transfer servers, to unknown destinations.
    *   Audit access logs on external-facing systems for signs of unauthorized access or credential abuse.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Ensure strict network segmentation between IT and OT networks.
    *   Enforce robust access controls and MFA on all external-facing systems, especially those used for file transfers.
    *   Maintain and test an incident response plan specifically for attacks on critical infrastructure components.

### 6. Sector & Geo Risk Signals

- **Energy / Critical Infrastructure:** This sector remains a high-value target for both nation-state and ransomware actors. The attack on Sweden's power grid operator by Everest ransomware and the CISA advisory for Veeder-Root fuel management systems highlight significant risk【https://gbhackers.com/swedens-power-grid-operator-admits-data-breach/ (2025-10-28T08:07:46.000Z)】【https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisa-warns-of-critical-veeder-root-vulnerabilities/ (2025-10-28T08:04:33.000Z)】.
- **Government:** Local and national government entities continue to be targeted. The ransomware attack on the City of Gloversville, NY, and the SideWinder APT campaign against South Asian diplomats underscore threats ranging from disruptive cybercrime to targeted espionage【https://www.news10.com/news/fulton-county/city-of-gloversville-hit-by-ransomware-attack/ (2025-10-28T08:34:31.000Z)】【https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/sidewinder-adopts-new-clickonce-based.html (2025-10-28T09:31:00.000Z)】.
- **Geopolitical:** The Israel-Iran conflict appears to have correlated with a temporary drop in observed malicious traffic from Iran, possibly due to internet connectivity restrictions imposed by the Iranian government【https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2025/10/tsubame_overflow_2025-04-06.html (2025-10-28T05:00:00.000Z)】.

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **Microsoft WSUS:** The active exploitation of CVE-2025-59287 represents a direct software supply chain risk. Organizations rely on WSUS to distribute trusted patches; its compromise allows attackers to distribute malware under the guise of legitimate updates, enabling rapid and widespread internal compromise【https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/microsoft-cve-2025-59287/ (2025-10-27T19:45:54.000Z)】.
- **X (formerly Twitter):** The platform is retiring the `twitter.com` domain for logins, which requires all users of hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKeys) and passkeys to re-enroll their authenticators by November 10, 2025. While not an attack, this change in a major third-party service could lead to user account lockouts if not addressed【https://securityaffairs.com/183928/security/x-warns-users-to-re-enroll-passkeys-and-yubikeys-for-2fa-by-nov-10.html (2025-10-28T06:27:07.000Z)】.

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **New Detection Rules:**
    *   Added Sigma rule `TI_Win_Suspicious_WSUS_Child_Process` to detect potential exploitation of CVE-2025-59287.
    *   Added Sigma rule `TI_Win_Qilin_Veeam_Harvesting` to detect PowerShell commands used by Qilin ransomware to extract credentials from Veeam backups.
- **Response Playbook Updates:**
    *   Updated the Ransomware Response Playbook to include specific checks for Qilin TTPs, including verifying the integrity of Veeam backup servers and looking for the presence of unauthorized tools like Cyberduck.
    *   Enhanced the Supply Chain Compromise playbook with specific steps for responding to a potential WSUS server compromise, including network isolation and forced re-validation of all distributed updates.

***

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

*(Note: The following are representative examples of metrics for an internal report.)*

- **Exposure Changes:** External asset count: 1,250 (+5 from yesterday). 12 critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched on public-facing systems (target: <5).
- **Patch Status:** Patching for CVE-2025-59287 (WSUS) is in progress, currently at 40% completion. Priority 1 action is to complete this by EOD. Chrome updates for CVE-2025-2783 are at 95% compliance across managed endpoints.
- **Detection Alerts:** 5 high-priority alerts related to suspicious PowerShell execution on backup servers are currently under investigation by the SOC, potentially related to Qilin TTPs.

***

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that ransomware groups like Qilin primarily target organizations based on opportunity and perceived ability to pay, rather than a specific industry vertical, although manufacturing is currently overrepresented. **Confidence: Medium.**
- **Intelligence Gap:** We lack visibility into the specific initial access vector used by the Everest group against Svenska kraftnät. It is unknown if it was a vulnerability, phishing, or other method.
- **Tasking:**
    *   Task IT Operations to provide a complete inventory of all servers running WSUS and confirm the application status of the latest patch for CVE-2025-59287.
    *   Task the Threat Hunting team to proactively search for evidence of Qilin's TTPs, specifically focusing on Veeam backup server logs and network traffic to cloud storage services.
    *   Task IT to verify all WordPress instances and confirm the status of the GutenKit and Hunk Companion plugins.
