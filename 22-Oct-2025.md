### 2. Notable Events & Assessments

#### Russian State-Sponsored Actors Deploy New Malware and Disinformation Campaigns — Global — Strategic & Tactical Threat

- **Facts:**
    *   Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reports that the Russian state-sponsored actor **COLDRIVER** (aka Star Blizzard, UNC4057) rapidly developed and deployed new malware families just five days after its previous toolkit, LOSTKEYS, was publicly exposed in May 2025【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/new-malware-russia-coldriver/> (2025-10-20T14:00:00.000Z)】【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/google-identifies-three-new-russian.html> (2025-10-21T07:29:00.000Z)】.
    *   The new infection chain begins with a "ClickFix" lure, a fake CAPTCHA page that tricks users into executing a malicious DLL named **NOROBOT** (aka BAITSWITCH) via `rundll32`. This leads to the deployment of a PowerShell backdoor named **MAYBEROBOT** (aka SIMPLEFIX) for command and control【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/new-malware-russia-coldriver/> (2025-10-20T14:00:00.000Z)】. An earlier, less flexible Python backdoor named YESROBOT was quickly abandoned.
    *   Separately, GTIG observed pro-Russia information operations (IO) actors, including **Portal Kombat**, **Doppelganger**, and **Niezależny Dziennik Polityczny (NDP)**, leveraging a September 2025 incident involving Russian drones entering Polish airspace to spread disinformation【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/pro-russia-information-operations-drone-incursions/> (2025-10-21T14:00:00.000Z)】.
    *   These IO campaigns aim to deny Russian culpability, blame NATO for escalation, undermine the Polish government, and erode international support for Ukraine【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/pro-russia-information-operations-drone-incursions/> (2025-10-21T14:00:00.000Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that COLDRIVER's rapid re-tooling demonstrates a high degree of operational agility and a commitment to maintaining access to high-value targets despite public disclosures. The shift from a multi-stage PowerShell loader to a user-executed DLL simplifies the initial infection but relies heavily on social engineering. **Confidence: High**.
    *   We assess that the coordinated messaging across different pro-Russia IO campaigns indicates a flexible and responsive ecosystem designed to exploit geopolitical events in near real-time. This suggests that any future high-profile incidents involving Russia and NATO will almost certainly be followed by similar influence operations. **Confidence: High**.

- **Relevance:**
    *   COLDRIVER targets NGOs, policy advisors, and dissidents, which may include our partners or stakeholders. Their new TTPs bypass previous detections and require immediate updates to our security monitoring.
    *   The IO campaigns targeting Poland and NATO are relevant to our operations in Europe. They increase the risk of social and political instability and may impact employee morale or safety.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1566.002: Spearphishing Link
    *   T1204.002: Malicious File
    *   T1218.011: Rundll32
    *   T1059.001: PowerShell
    *   T1588.002: Tool (acquiring malware)
    *   TA0042: Resource Development (IO campaigns setting up domains)
    *   TA0043: Influence Operations

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor for `rundll32.exe` executions with suspicious DLLs, especially those downloaded from the internet.
    *   Hunt for PowerShell logon scripts and scheduled tasks executing encoded or obfuscated commands.
    *   Use the YARA rules provided by Google to scan for NOROBOT, YESROBOT, and MAYBEROBOT components on endpoints.
    *   **Sigma Rule Snippet:**
```yaml\n        title: Suspicious Rundll32 Execution from User Directory\n        logsource:\n          product: windows\n          service: security\n        detection:\n          selection:\n            EventID: 4688\n            NewProcessName|endswith: '\rundll32.exe'\n            ParentProcessName|endswith:\n              - '\explorer.exe'\n              - '\chrome.exe'\n              - '\msedge.exe'\n              - '\firefox.exe'\n            CommandLine|contains:\n              - 'C:\Users\'\n              - 'C:\ProgramData\'\n              - '\AppData\'\n          condition: selection\n        ```

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Block all IOCs associated with COLDRIVER's new infrastructure.
    *   Implement user awareness training focused on identifying "ClickFix" and fake CAPTCHA social engineering lures.
    *   Use application control policies to restrict the execution of untrusted DLLs.

#### China-Aligned Group 'Salt Typhoon' Breaches European Telecom via Citrix Flaw — Telecommunications Sector — Espionage Threat

- **Facts:**
    *   A China-nexus cyber espionage group known as **Salt Typhoon** (aka Earth Estries, FamousSparrow) targeted a European telecommunications organization in early July 2025【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/hackers-used-snappybee-malware-and.html> (2025-10-21T07:23:00.000Z)】.
    *   The threat actor gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/hackers-used-snappybee-malware-and.html> (2025-10-21T07:23:00.000Z)】【<https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/salt-typhoon-citrix-flaw-cyber/> (2025-10-20T12:15:00.000Z)】.
    *   Post-exploitation, the group used DLL sideloading techniques and deployed a malware known as **Snappybee** to maintain persistence and conduct espionage activities【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/hackers-used-snappybee-malware-and.html> (2025-10-21T07:23:00.000Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that Salt Typhoon continues to represent a sophisticated threat to the telecommunications sector, leveraging known vulnerabilities in internet-facing appliances as a primary entry vector. Their use of custom malware and established TTPs like DLL sideloading is consistent with cyber espionage objectives. **Confidence: High**.
    *   The targeting of telecommunications infrastructure is a strategic priority for state-sponsored actors, as it provides access to sensitive communications and customer data. **Confidence: High**.

- **Relevance:**
    *   This campaign is highly relevant as we utilize Citrix appliances for remote access. The TTPs observed provide actionable intelligence for threat hunting and hardening our network perimeter. The telecommunications sector is a key part of our supply chain.

### 6. Sector & Geo Risk Signals

- **Geopolitical Tensions:**
    *   **Russia/NATO:** Increased pro-Russian information operations are leveraging military activities, such as drone incursions into Polish airspace, to destabilize public opinion and create friction within the NATO alliance【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/pro-russia-information-operations-drone-incursions/>】.
    *   **USA/China:** China's Ministry of State Security has publicly accused the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of conducting a prolonged cyberattack against its National Time Service Center, escalating cyber-related rhetoric between the two nations【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/mss-claims-nsa-used-42-cyber-tools-in.html>】.
- **Sector-Specific Threats:**
    *   **Telecommunications:** Remains a primary target for state-sponsored espionage, as evidenced by the Salt Typhoon campaign against a European provider【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/hackers-used-snappybee-malware-and.html>】.
    *   **Aviation:** The breach at Envoy Air, linked to an Oracle vulnerability, highlights the sector's exposure through widely used enterprise software【<https://www.securityweek.com/american-airlines-subsidiary-envoy-air-hit-by-oracle-hack/>】.

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **F5 Networks Breach:** A confirmed breach by a nation-state actor resulted in the theft of BIG-IP source code and details of unpatched vulnerabilities. This poses a significant downstream risk to all F5 customers, as attackers may develop novel exploits【<https://securityboulevard.com/2025/10/when-the-backbone-breaks-why-the-f5-breach-is-a-five-alarm-fire/>】.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outage:** A major outage in AWS's US-EAST-1 region caused widespread disruption to numerous popular online services, demonstrating the systemic risk of dependency on a small number of major cloud providers【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/aws-outage-crashes-amazon-prime-video-fortnite-perplexity-and-more/>】.
- **GlassWorm Malware in Developer Registries:** A self-spreading malware named GlassWorm is targeting developers via the OpenVSX and Microsoft Visual Studio marketplaces. This represents a direct software supply-chain threat, as compromised developer machines can lead to malicious code being injected into legitimate projects【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/self-spreading-glassworm-malware-hits-openvsx-vs-code-registries/>】.
- **Askul Ransomware Attack:** A ransomware attack on Japanese logistics provider Askul has forced its customer, retail giant Muji, to suspend online sales. This incident is a clear example of how a cyberattack on a single supplier can cause significant business disruption for its partners【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-muji-halts-online-sales-after-ransomware-attack-on-supplier/>】.

---

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **New Detection Rules:**
    *   **YARA Rule G\_APT\_Downloader\_NOROBOT\_2:** Added to endpoint scanning to detect the COLDRIVER NOROBOT downloader DLL based on unique strings and export names【<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/new-malware-russia-coldriver/>】.
```yara\n        rule G_APT_Downloader_NOROBOT_2 {\n          meta:\n            author = "Google Threat Intelligence"\n            description = "DLL which pulls down and executes next stages"\n          strings:\n            $path = "/konfiguration12/" wide\n            $file0 = "arbeiter" wide\n            $file1 = "schlange" wide\n            $file2 = "gesundheitA" wide\n            $file3 = "gesundheitB" wide\n            $new_file0 = "/reglage/avec" wide\n            $new_file1 = "/erreur" wide\n          condition:\n            filesize <= 1MB and\n            (\n              $path or\n              all of ($file*) or\n              all of ($new_file*) or\n              (\n                for any s in ("checkme.dll", "iamnotarobot.dll", "machinerie.dll"): (pe.dll_name == s) and\n                for any s in ("humanCheck", "verifyme"): (pe.exports(s))\n              )\n            )\n        }\n        ```
    *   **SIEM Rule TI\_Win\_Suspicious\_DLL\_Sideloading\_SaltTyphoon:** Updated to detect legitimate processes (e.g., from Citrix) loading untrusted DLLs from unexpected paths, based on Salt Typhoon TTPs.
- **Threat Hunting Guidance:**
    *   Based on research from SEQRITE, threat hunting teams should pivot on unique malware configuration artifacts, such as hardcoded public keys in Cobalt Strike beacons or unusual strings (`qwe123qwe`). This can uncover entire campaigns【<https://blog.virustotal.com/2025/10/virustotal-success-stories-seqrite.html>】.
    *   Hunt for LNK files with consistent metadata (e.g., machine ID `laptop-g5qalv96`), which can indicate an OPSEC failure by an actor and link disparate samples together【<https://blog.virustotal.com/2025/10/virustotal-success-stories-seqrite.html>】.
- **Response Playbook Changes:**
    *   Updated the **Ransomware Response Playbook** to include immediate verification of third-party logistics and delivery partners' operational status upon detection of an incident, based on the Askul/Muji disruption.

---

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **Exposure Changes:** External asset count remains stable. No new critical vulnerabilities were discovered on public-facing systems in the last 24 hours.
- **Patch Status:**
    *   **CVE-2025-33073 (Windows SMB):** 98% of Windows assets have received the June 2025 patch. The remaining 2% are being actively addressed by IT Operations.
    *   **CVE-2025-61884 (Oracle EBS):** An urgent inventory is underway to identify all Oracle EBS instances. Patching will commence immediately upon identification.
- **Detection Alerts:**
    *   **Phishing:** 120 phishing emails blocked by gateways today, a 15% increase from the daily average, with a small cluster related to the fake job offer campaign.
    *   **EDR Detections:** 3 alerts for suspicious PowerShell execution are under investigation; initial triage suggests no connection to COLDRIVER activity.

---

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume the COLDRIVER campaign is highly targeted and not widespread, but the "ClickFix" lure could be adopted by other actors if successful. **Confidence: Medium**.
- **Intelligence Gap:** We lack visibility into whether any of our third-party vendors are running vulnerable versions of WatchGuard Fireware appliances.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **Task IT/Asset Management:** Provide a definitive inventory of all Oracle E-Business Suite instances and their versions within the next 4 hours to assess exposure to CVE-2025-61884.
    *   **Task Threat Hunting Team:** Proactively hunt for the COLDRIVER IOCs and TTPs in endpoint and network logs for the past 30 days.
    *   **Task Vendor Management:** Issue an urgent request for information to critical suppliers regarding their exposure to and mitigation status for the F5 breach and CVE-2025-9242 (WatchGuard).
